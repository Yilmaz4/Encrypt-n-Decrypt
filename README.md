# Encrypt-n-Decrypt

Hello everyone, this is my first Python project that I published here. This project can encrypt and decrypt plain texts with AES-256 (256-bit) encryption standart. Program uses cryptography.fernet library and Python 3. Program also only compatible with Windows Vista, 7, 8.1 and 10. It's currently not compatible with any Linux and OS-X. Also in next updates, program will able to encrypt files and folders using AES-256 (256-bit) encryption standart too. This project is open-source so you can look inside source files to see how this program works and how you can find all easter-eggs. Yes, I have hidden some easter-eggs. Let's see if you can find!
