    <p>Welcome to Encrypt-n-Decrypt documentation! In this short documentation, you can find
        information about how to use the program as well as a brief explanation of the source
        code.

        <hr color="21262d">

        Encrypt-n-Decrypt is a program which is capable of encrypting and decrypting data using
        diverse encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), 3DES (Triple
        Data Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman).<br><br>

        In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding information. This process
        converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into
        an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can
        decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.
        Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content
        to a would-be interceptor.<br><br>

        To decrypt the data that you've encrypted using a symmetric key encryption algorithm
        (AES or 3DES) using this program, you need to have the key called "encryption key"
        which was used to encrypt the data. Similarly, to decrypt a piece of asymmetrically
        encrypted data (using RSA algorithm), you need to have a key called "private key".<br><br>

        However, asymmetric key encryption is not available yet. I'm currently working on it
        but I'm stuck at the part of placing the input widgets. You can expect RSA algorithm
        to be usable in the next few months.<br><br>
